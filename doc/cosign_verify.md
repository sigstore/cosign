## cosign verify

Verify a signature on the supplied container image

### Synopsis

Verify signature and annotations on an image by checking the claims
against the transparency log.

```
cosign verify [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  cosign verify --key <key path>|<key url>|<kms uri> <image uri> [<image uri> ...]

  # verify cosign claims and signing certificates on the image with the transparency log
  cosign verify <IMAGE>

  # verify multiple images
  cosign verify <IMAGE_1> <IMAGE_2> ...

  # additionally verify specified annotations
  cosign verify -a key1=val1 -a key2=val2 <IMAGE>

  # verify image with an on-disk public key
  cosign verify --key cosign.pub <IMAGE>

  # verify image with an on-disk public key, manually specifying the
  # signature digest algorithm
  cosign verify --key cosign.pub --signature-digest-algorithm sha512 <IMAGE>

  # verify image with an on-disk signed image from 'cosign save'
  cosign verify --key cosign.pub --local-image <PATH>

  # verify image with local certificate and certificate chain
  cosign verify --cert cosign.crt --cert-chain chain.crt <IMAGE>

  # verify image using keyless verification with the given certificate
  # chain and identity parameters, without Fulcio roots (for BYO PKI):
  cosign verify --cert-chain chain.crt --certificate-oidc-issuer https://issuer.example.com --certificate-identity foo@example.com <IMAGE>

  # verify image with public key provided by URL
  cosign verify --key https://host.for/[FILE] <IMAGE>

  # verify image with a key stored in an environment variable
  cosign verify --key env://[ENV_VAR] <IMAGE>

  # verify image with public key stored in Google Cloud KMS
  cosign verify --key gcpkms://projects/[PROJECT]/locations/global/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY] <IMAGE>

  # verify image with public key stored in Hashicorp Vault
  cosign verify --key hashivault://[KEY] <IMAGE>

  # verify image with public key stored in a Kubernetes secret
  cosign verify --key k8s://[NAMESPACE]/[KEY] <IMAGE>

  # verify image with public key stored in GitLab with project name
  cosign verify --key gitlab://[OWNER]/[PROJECT_NAME] <IMAGE>

  # verify image with public key stored in GitLab with project id
  cosign verify --key gitlab://[PROJECT_ID] <IMAGE>

Must contain the root CA certificate. Optionally may contain intermediate CA certificates, and may contain the leaf TSA certificate if not present in the timestamp
