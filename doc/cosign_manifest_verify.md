## cosign manifest verify

Verify all signatures of images specified in the manifest

### Synopsis

Verify all signature of images in a Kubernetes resource manifest by checking claims
against the transparency log.

```
cosign manifest verify [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  cosign manifest verify --key <key path>|<key url>|<kms uri> <path/to/manifest>

  # verify cosign claims and signing certificates on images in the manifest
  cosign manifest verify <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # additionally verify specified annotations
  cosign manifest verify -a key1=val1 -a key2=val2 <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # (experimental) additionally, verify with the transparency log
  COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign manifest verify <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key
  cosign manifest verify --key cosign.pub <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key provided by URL
  cosign manifest verify --key https://host.for/<FILE> <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key stored in Azure Key Vault
  cosign manifest verify --key azurekms://[VAULT_NAME][VAULT_URI]/[KEY] <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key stored in AWS KMS
  cosign manifest verify --key awskms://[ENDPOINT]/[ID/ALIAS/ARN] <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key stored in Google Cloud KMS
  cosign manifest verify --key gcpkms://projects/[PROJECT]/locations/global/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY] <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key stored in Hashicorp Vault
