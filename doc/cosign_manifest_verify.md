## cosign manifest verify

Verify all signatures of images specified in the manifest

### Synopsis

Verify all signature of images in a Kubernetes resource manifest by checking claims
against the transparency log.

```
cosign manifest verify [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  cosign manifest verify --key <key path>|<key url>|<kms uri> <path/to/manifest>

  # verify cosign claims and signing certificates on images in the manifest
  cosign manifest verify <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # additionally verify specified annotations
  cosign manifest verify -a key1=val1 -a key2=val2 <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

  # verify images with public key
  cosign manifest verify --key cosign.pub <path/to/my-deployment.yaml>

Must contain the root CA certificate. Optionally may contain intermediate CA certificates, and may contain the leaf TSA certificate if not present in the timestamp
