    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # metrics.backend-destination field specifies the system metrics destination.
    # It supports either prometheus (the default) or stackdriver.
    # Note: Using stackdriver will incur additional charges
    metrics.backend-destination: prometheus

    # metrics.request-metrics-backend-destination specifies the request metrics
    # destination. If non-empty, it enables queue proxy to send request metrics.
    # Currently supported values: prometheus, stackdriver.
    metrics.request-metrics-backend-destination: prometheus

    # metrics.stackdriver-project-id field specifies the stackdriver project ID. This
    # field is optional. When running on GCE, application default credentials will be
    # used if this field is not provided.
    metrics.stackdriver-project-id: "<your stackdriver project id>"
