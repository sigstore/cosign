The following options are used by default:
	- The initial 1.root.json is embedded inside cosign.
	- SigStore current TUF repository is pulled from the GCS mirror at sigstore-tuf-root.
	- A default threshold of 3 root signatures is used.

To provide an out-of-band trusted initial root.json, use the -root flag with a file or URL reference.

The resulting updated TUF repository will be written to $HOME/.sigstore/root/.

Trusted keys and certificate used in cosign verification (e.g. verifying Fulcio issued certificates
with Fulcio root CA) are pulled form the trusted metadata.`,
		Example: `  cosign initialize -mirror <url> -out <file>

  # initialize root with distributed root keys, default mirror, and default out path.
  cosign initialize

  # initialize with an out-of-band root key file.
  cosign initialize

  # initialize with an out-of-band root key file and custom repository mirror.
  cosign initialize -mirror <url> -root <url>`,
