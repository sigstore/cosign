## v0.1.0

This is the first release of `cosign`!

The main goal of this release is to release something we can start using to sign other releases of [sigstore](sigstore.dev) projects, including `cosign` itself.

We expect many flags, commands, and formats to change going forward.
No backwards compatiblity is promised or implied.

### Enhancements

This release added a feature to `cosign` called `cosign`.
The `cosign` feature can be used to sign container images and blobs.
Detailed documentation can be found in the [README](README.md) and the [Detailed Usage](USAGE.md).

### Bug Fixes

There was no way to sign container images. Now there is!
