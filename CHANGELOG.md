# Changelog

## v1.3.0

* BREAKING: `verify-manifest` is now `manifest verify` (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/712)
* WARNING: The CLI now uses POSIX-style (double-dash `--flag`) for long-form flags. It will temporarily accept the single-dash `-flag` form with a warning, which will become an error in a future release (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/835)
* Added `sget` as part of Cosign's releases (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/752)
* The `copasetic` binary was unceremoniously [baleeted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07h0ksKx5sM) (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/785)

### Enhancements

* Began reworking `pkg` around new abstrations for signing, verification, and storage (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/issues/666)
    * Notice: refactoring of `pkg` will continue in the next minor release. Please leave feedback, especially if you've been experimenting with `cosign` as a library and found it lacking (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/issues/844)
    * [GGCR-style libraries](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry#philosophy) for interacting with images now exist under `pkg/oci` (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/770)
    * `pkg/cosign/remote.UploadSignature` API was been removed in favor of new `pkg/oci/remote` APIs (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/774)
    * The function signature of `cosign.Verify` was changed so that callers must be explicit about which signatures (or attestations) to verify. For matching signatures, see also `cosign.Verify{Signatures,Attestations}` (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/782)
    * Removed `cremote.UploadFile` in favor of `static.NewFile` and `remote.Write` (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/797)
* Innumerable other improvements to the codebase and automation ([Makin me look bad, @mattmoor](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commits?author=mattmoor))
* Migrated the CLI to `cobra` ([Welcome to the team, @n3wscott](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commits?author=n3wscott))
* Added the `--allow-insecure-registry` flag to disable TLS verification when interacting with insecure (e.g. self-signed) container registries (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/669)
* 🔒 `cosigned` now includes a mutating webhook that resolves image tags to digests (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/800)
* 🔒 The `cosigned` validating webhook now requires image digest references (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/799)
* The `cosigned` webhook now ignores resources that are being deleted (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/803)
* The `cosigned` webhook now supports resolving private images that are authenticated via `imagePullSecrets` (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/804)
* `manifest verify` now supports verifying images in all Kubernetes objects that fit within `PodSpec`, `PodSpecTemplate`, or `JobSpecTemplate`, including CRDs (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/697)
* Added shell auto-completion support (Clutch collab from @erkanzileli, @passcod, and @Dentrax! https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/836)
* `cosign` has generated Markdown docs available in the `doc/` directory (https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/839)

### Bug Fixes

* `cosigned` now verifies `CronJob` images (Terve, @vaikas https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/809)
* Fixed the `verify` `--cert-email` option to actually work (Sweet as, @passcod https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/821)

## v0.1.0

This is the first release of `cosign`!

The main goal of this release is to release something we can start using to sign other releases of [sigstore](sigstore.dev) projects, including `cosign` itself.

We expect many flags, commands, and formats to change going forward.
No backwards compatiblity is promised or implied.

### Enhancements

This release added a feature to `cosign` called `cosign`.
The `cosign` feature can be used to sign container images and blobs.
Detailed documentation can be found in the [README](README.md) and the [Detailed Usage](USAGE.md).

### Bug Fixes

There was no way to sign container images. Now there is!
